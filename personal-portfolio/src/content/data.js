It is an opportunity for student teams to design net-zero-energy-water buildings, contributing to real projects, while partnering with the leaders in real estate development. This is the resilient and carbon-neutral way forward for our sustainable buildings and communities. I am working on Renewable Energy and Use of Electronic systems for Convenience and Energy conservation.",
